# Parallel_UED_calculation
Calculation of random UED data points inside the pre-defined parameter range by using the SRF Photoinjector Astra model. The calculation is paralellized to be run in a multi-core server.  

**Disclaimer**: This code is design to be run with python 2.* and not with python 3., as the later is not available in the linux server where the code runs. The code also needs to be run without pandas, which would have made many tasks easier and faster.
